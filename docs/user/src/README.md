# Overview

Welcome to GoodMorning Tex - a minimal and easy to use **multiformat editor** and publishing platform for the web.

![](./assets/editor.png)

You have the freedom to publish your work privately or publicly, written in any format. Browse notes by others or take your own (the "I paid attention in class" flex), it's entirely up to you.

> GM Tex is a fresh project in its early development, ***missing features are expected***.

## Roadmap

As in early development, here are some of the features which GM Tex currently offers, or are planned to be implemented.

- [x] Compiling LaTex, Markdown documents.
- [x] Previewing plain text files, images and documents.
- [x] Editing files in web editor.
- [ ] Basic file operations. (missing moving/renaming files)
- [x] Full profile customisations.

---

- [ ] Publishing documents (cannot directly access items using publish ID, nor is it in web UI)
- [ ] Creating collections from published items.
- [ ] Following users, collections, and get notifications from it.

## Goals

The goal is to create a **federated publishing service**, for learners to read and write notes, and *I-want-internet-validation* people to publish articles for upvotes.
