> GM Tex is a fresh project in its early development, ***missing features are expected***.

## Why GoodMorning Tex

**Because it feels like home**, everyone is given their own file system. You are completely free to structure your document however you wish. Such flexibility is not permitted in services such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), as you were forced to organised into a flat list of documents - without nesting support.

In GM Tex, nesting can easily be achieved. As it is a **basic file system features** to create folders and subfolders, the file system on GM Tex is just as powerful as the one running on your system.
