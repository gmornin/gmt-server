        <p>And that is just the most basic clothes you can get.</p>
        <p>
          If you want to have an extra set of clothes from the muddy one which
          you wear while working, for example to wear when sleeping, you’d
          better save up.
        </p>
        <p>
          A labourer earns £2 a year, or 2 pence a day. The set of clothes would
          cost you a whole month of wage even if you starve yourself.

        <p>Weaving and sewing became separate crafts practised separately.</p>
        <p>
          Rich people would usually employ tailors to have clothes custom-made,
          where they will provide the fabric, while the tailor would bring their
          own thread.
        </p>
        <p>Same for embroidery, they would employ an embroiderer for that.</p>
        <p>
          Even richer households, such as royal families would have tailors and
          embroiderers on staff.

          I could not be making this up, but british wool is considered to be
          superior

        <p>
          Because of its cool, wet, “nice weather” climate allows for longer
          grazing season,
        </p>
        <p>So the fabric is fine and long.</p>

        <h3>Page 9</h3>
        <p>The weave used would also be a consideration factor</p>
        <p>
          More expensive weave would use a special pattern weave, if you are
          feeling special, instead of a normal basket weave that every normal
          people use
        </p>
        <p>
          And yes, you can get fabric that is softened properly from that
          fulling mill if you pay extra.

          Linen dont take up dye very well, so they are typically left undyed

        <p>
          We dont really know exactly how much of linen and hemp are used,
          because they are plant fibres,

          Animal skin has been associated with paganism (practising polytheist
          religions,term by the roman church) and barbarity So nobody really
